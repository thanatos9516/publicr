          <p>We aren't some faceless entity way down in Southern Ontario. We don't communicate by fax and mass e-mailers.

            <br/>
           FCH Maintenance strives to maintain a personal connection with our clients.

        <!--<h3 style="text-align:center; color:green">Anthony Chan</h3>
        <p>At the age of 18, in beautiful Costa Rica, Anthony Chan broke away from tradition.  Instead of carrying on with the family restaurants, Anthony pursued a career in Microelectronics.  By 25 the call of adventure caused him to turn his back on a promising career and leave the country of his birth. He set his sights on Canada.  With little more in his pockets than good advice from his Grandfather, who taught him that there are many opportunities in this world,  we need only have the courage to seize them.  Anthony quickly learned his most valuable asset, to himself and to his new country, was his hope for the future and his determination to succeed.
        <br>
        <br>
        Following his Grandfather's advice, Anthony quickly learned English. He first learned how to remodel homes, then tackled masonry.  A few years later Anthony began cleaning large grocery stores and office buildings.  He discovered by working smarter, not harder, thousands of square feet could be transformed overnight.  He gathered as many techniques and tricks as he could, learning how to get results in the harshest of conditions.
        <br>
        <br>
        By 2010, he was ready to go into business for himself. The company he founded on a meager budget, was powered by Anthony's determination and attention to detail.  Anthony will often say if you want something done right, do it yourself.  This hands on approach sets FCH apart from the rest.  When Anthony brought on an experienced General Manager the business quickly expanded.     
        <br>
        <br>
        Over the years the company has grown to service several locations in several cities.  From only offering cleaning services to a select few stores to providing full  maintenance services throughout Northern Ontario.  When FCH began offering equipment repair and preventative maintenance services, a name change seemed appropriate.  At the core of this company remains a strong work ethic and a commitment to quality driven by its founder, the remarkable Anthony Chan.
        <br> 
        Anthony speaks three languages and is currently working on a fourth.  When he's not transforming yellow tiles into glossy mirrors he is with his three beautiful children.
